      Step 1: Import Data Set in the formate is CVS file.
      Step 2: Clear dublicate data and missing information, such as a lack of a column for a description.
      Step 3: Split the data set for ( X )% for trainning set and ( 100 - X )% for the test set.
      Step 4: Create a Model.
      Step 5: Train the Model.
      Step 6: Make Predictions.
      Step 7: Evaluate and Improve.
  
# Libaray
      1. Numpy -> multidimensional array for store data set
      2. Pandas -> Data Analysis 
      3. MatPlotLib -> X,Y graph in 2D
      4. Scikit_Learn -> Provide Algorithm for Machine Learning like decision tree and others.
